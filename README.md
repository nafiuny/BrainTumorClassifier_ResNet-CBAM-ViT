# ResNet-CBAM-ViT: A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Brain Tumor Classification in MRI using Frequency and Attention-Based.
<br><br>
This project focuses on automated classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT).
<br><br>
Our custom model architecture leverages the local feature extraction power of CNNs and the global attention capabilities of ViT to accurately classify brain tumor types into four categories:
Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor.
<br><br>
The model is trained on a preprocessed dataset of axial brain MRI images, and has shown robust performance in validation and test phases.
